# Numpy (Numerical Python) - A Python library used for working with arrays.

# 1. Create a numpy array

# Numpy array-
# a. Optimized for numerical operations (homogenous data types)
# b. Store elements of same data type
# c. Supports vectorized operations, which are faster

# The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)

# ndarray
print(type(arr))
